# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Out of the Void

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A 2D bullet hell game in which the player must escape the void.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

A video game where the player must dodge a flurry of projectiles sent at them while also defeating enemies. The player will obtain upgrades as they progress. Upgrades will change how the player
interacts with the game in different ways. From different attacks, movement, and defense options. More colors will appear as well as the player gets closer to the end.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A game with a player character and enemies that launch projectiles. The player must defeat these enemies.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

As above, but with upgrades to the player as they slay enemies.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The most ideal outcome is a video game in which a player starts with a very limited set of abilities. As the player defeats enemies, they can unlock new abilties (different attacks, movement options, and defensive items) and upgrade the ones they already have.
There will be multiple enemy types to provide unique challenges to the player.
Environments will be randomly generated, allowing for some replayability.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

As I am working by myself, first I will need to find a suitable game engine (Godot, Unity, Unreal Engine).
Then I must learn from scratch how to use the game engine (e.g. scripting, assets, animations, etc.).
I must learn how to create art (likely pixe art) and sound design.
